# 📖 Booking Reminder Application <a name="about-project"></a>

<br>
This project is created with [`create-expo-app`]. Our user-friendly platform, which features two dedicated repositories for front-end and back-end, empowers users to effortlessly manage their time and clients by booking appointments. It has the capability to notify a client about a booking one day in advance. Behind the scenes, our robust back-end, Ruby on Rails, efficiently manages data operations, including GET, PUT, POST, and DESTROY, ensuring a smooth and secure user experience. The app is currently available for web.<br>
